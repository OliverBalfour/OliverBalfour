Hi, I'm Oliver!

I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/), where I build tools to help with language model interpretability research.

I'm also a computer science and mathematics student studing at the Australian National University.

I'm interested in machine learning safety, software engineering and effective altruism.

I've built everything from [control panels for rocket engine testing rigs](https://github.com/ANU-Rocketry/control-panel) to [an algorithm for diagnosing eye disease](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/DiabeticRetinopathy).

I'll be interning at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) at the end of the year.

I previously worked for [Liquid Instruments](https://www.liquidinstruments.com/), where I built user interfaces for scientific instruments.
