Hi, I'm Oliver!

I'm a computer science and mathematics student interested in machine learning safety, software engineering and effective altruism. I'm currently based in Australia.

I've built everything from [control panels for rocket engine testing rigs](https://github.com/ANU-Rocketry/control-panel) to [an algorithm for diagnosing eye disease](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/DiabeticRetinopathy).

I'm excited to be interning at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) and attending the [ML Alignment Bootcamp](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3ouxBRRzjxarTukMW/apply-to-the-second-iteration-of-the-ml-for-alignment) later this year. I currently work for [Liquid Instruments](https://www.liquidinstruments.com/), where I mainly build user interfaces for scientific instruments.
