Hi, I'm Oliver. I'm studying mathematics and computer science at the Australian National University and working as a software developer at [Liquid Instruments](https://www.liquidinstruments.com/).

I love functional programming, machine learning, computer graphics, UI development (web/desktop/mobile), abstract algebra, cycling, and modular origami.

I have a [blog](https://oliverbalfour.github.io/) and lots of open source projects below.
