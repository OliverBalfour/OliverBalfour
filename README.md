Hi, I'm Oliver!

I'm currently studying computer science and mathematics at the Australian National University.

I've built everything from [control panels for rocket engine testing rigs](https://github.com/ANU-Rocketry/control-panel) to [an algorithm for diagnosing eye disease](https://github.com/OliverBalfour/DiabeticRetinopathy).

I've interned at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/), built language model interpretability tools at [Redwood Research](https://www.redwoodresearch.org/), and built user interfaces for scientific instruments at [Liquid Instruments](https://www.liquidinstruments.com/).

I'm interested in AI safety and software engineering. Feel free to reach out!
